                <p>Ate was released on July 19, 2024. Pre-orders of the EP began on June 19, coming in five versions—Ate, Chk Chk, Boom, Accordion, and Letter, as well as pre-save. Following the EP announcement, the group revealed the 3D animated vending machine-styled promotional itinerary on June 20, and, the next day, flyer-styled track listing and digital cover artwork of a metallic dental model decorated with Stray Kids-shaped grills. The series of individual, duo, and group teaser images and videos were posted in four sets. The first shows the "wild and free" and "hip and chic" members donning in black, white, and denim, engaging in different activities. The second depicts the members posing in front of their portrait background, and uses cane, metallic accessories, and dreamy red lights as props. The third expresses the members at a drained swimming pool, replaced with sand and cacti. The fourth shows another "hip"-style of the members wearing tooth gems, nail arts, and bold accessories with the background of a large structure of the beast's fangs.</p>

                <p>Two tracks from Ate—"Mountains" and "Stray Kids"—were teased as part of video series "Unveil: Track", and were included alongside other tracks on the EP's mashup video, which features visuals of Stray Kids in a CD factory. The day before its release, the group introduced the EP via the video Intro: Ate. Four music videos from Ate's tracks were uploaded: the lead single "Chk Chk Boom" premiered concurrently with Ate, and co-starred Canadian-American actor Ryan Reynolds and Australian actor Hugh Jackman wearing Deadpool and Wolverine costumes, respectively; the next two are "Mountains" and "Stray Kids" as part of their commemoration of the sixth anniversary of their fan club name announcement, called "Stay"; and the Ghostbusters-inspired "Jjam", released on August 7. To promote Ate, the members appeared on several television and web shows, including The King of Mask Singer, LeeMujin Service, Radio Star, Amazing Saturday, MMTG, Heat Eaters, and Knowing Bros, etc. Members Bang Chan and Felix hosted the group's own radio show All About Stray Kids Radio via Apple Music 1 between July 16 and 30 for four episodes, and the group launched a pop-up store from July 20 to August 1 at Empty, Seongsu-dong, Seoul.</p>
